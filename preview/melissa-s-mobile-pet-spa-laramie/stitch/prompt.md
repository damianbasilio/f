## Prompt (paste into Stitch)

You are an award-winning local-brand web designer building **one bespoke homepage** for **Melissa's Mobile Pet Spa**. This business has **no dedicated website** — only a Facebook page. You are not filling a template. You are designing a **unique, premium, memorable first impression** that could only belong to this business.

### Non-negotiable: uniqueness

- This site must **not** look like other local-business mockups, Webflow templates, or AI landing pages.
- **Do not** reuse the same hero layout, section order, card grid, or color story you used on other projects.
- **Invent** a fresh visual identity from the business type, name, location, and Facebook voice below.
- Aim for **editorial quality**: generous whitespace OR intentional density (pick one and commit), strong typographic hierarchy, one memorable visual motif (texture, rule, shape, photo treatment, or color block) that repeats subtly.
- Every section should feel **designed**, not assembled from a component library.

### Design read (follow this)
Reading this as: a first homepage for Melissa's Mobile Pet Spa in Laramie (Pet grooming / pet services), Friendly, caring, trustworthy — pets are family tone, **diagonal-cut** archetype — must feel like a one-off commission, not a reused template.

### Uniqueness mandate
- This homepage is for **Melissa's Mobile Pet Spa** only — it must not resemble other local-business sites or AI templates.
- **Invent** layout rhythm, section names, color story, and typographic personality for this business.
- Layout archetype **diagonal-cut**: Diagonal or angled section dividers (clip-path or skewed bands); hero with angled color block behind headline; dynamic but not chaotic.
- Primary CTA: **"Book grooming"**. Phone as `tel:` in header and hero.
- No menu section. No restaurant language. Soft or playful but not childish unless posts suggest it.

### Layout discipline
- Hero fits initial viewport: H1 max 2 lines, subhead max 20 words, primary CTA visible without scrolling.
- **No** repeated identical 3-column icon-card rows across sections.
- Vary structure: split hero → offerings (list, staggered grid, or bento) → gallery → visit → contact.
- Max 1 small uppercase eyebrow per 3 sections. Nav ~64–72px, phone or CTA visible on desktop.
- Cards only when elevation adds hierarchy; prefer spacing, rules, and type otherwise.

### Color & typography (you decide)
**Stitch decides all colors.** There is no brand manual, no website, and nothing to extract.
Derive a cohesive 4–5 color system from business type, name, location, and post voice.
Define `--brand-primary`, `--brand-secondary`, `--brand-accent`, and neutrals in `:root`.
Each business must look visually distinct — do not reuse the same palette across mockups.
Avoid Facebook platform grays (#333, #666, #ddd) and generic SaaS purple/indigo.

Choose typography that matches **Pet grooming / pet services** — premium and readable.
Suggested pairing (you may adapt if a better fit exists): **Source Serif 4** (headlines) + **Nunito** (body).
Load from Google Fonts. Never default to Inter, Roboto, or Arial as the primary personality.
Establish a clear type scale (display, h2, body, small) with intentional letter-spacing on labels.

- No purple/indigo SaaS gradients. No generic cream/beige page background unless the business genuinely calls for it.
- No em dashes (—) in copy. No emojis. No buzzwords: elevate, seamless, world-class, game-changer.

### Motion & interaction (emil-design-eng)
- Dials: variance 8/10 · motion 4/10 · density 6/10
- UI transitions: 150–250ms, **ease-out**. Never `transition: all`.
- Buttons: `:active { transform: scale(0.97) }`. Include `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Animate **transform** and **opacity** only.

### Anti-slop checklist
- No fake star ratings unless review score is in the brief.
- No side-stripe accent borders on cards. No gradient text on headlines.
- No lorem ipsum. No stock URLs. Gallery and hero sized for **their** Facebook photos.
- Form is preview-only — never simulate "Message sent".
