## Prompt (paste into Stitch)

You are an award-winning local-brand web designer building **one bespoke homepage** for **Le’s Nails & Spa**. This business has **no dedicated website** — only a Facebook page. You are not filling a template. You are designing a **unique, premium, memorable first impression** that could only belong to this business.

### Non-negotiable: uniqueness

- This site must **not** look like other local-business mockups, Webflow templates, or AI landing pages.
- **Do not** reuse the same hero layout, section order, card grid, or color story you used on other projects.
- **Invent** a fresh visual identity from the business type, name, location, and Facebook voice below.
- Aim for **editorial quality**: generous whitespace OR intentional density (pick one and commit), strong typographic hierarchy, one memorable visual motif (texture, rule, shape, photo treatment, or color block) that repeats subtly.
- Every section should feel **designed**, not assembled from a component library.
- Whole email should be 100 words or less.

### Design read (follow this)
Reading this as: a first homepage for Le’s Nails & Spa in Warner Robins (Salon / spa / personal care), Polished, relaxing, appointment-ready tone, **bento-showcase** archetype — must feel like a one-off commission, not a reused template.

### Uniqueness mandate
- This homepage is for **Le’s Nails & Spa** only — it must not resemble other local-business sites or AI templates.
- **Invent** layout rhythm, section names, color story, and typographic personality for this business.
- Layout archetype **bento-showcase**: Bento-style grid: hero spans 2 cells, services and gallery as varied tile sizes; no identical card heights; one accent tile in primary color.
- Primary CTA: **"Book appointment"**. Phone as `tel:` in header and hero.
- No food menu language. Gallery should showcase work, not template beauty shots.

### Layout discipline
- Hero fits initial viewport: H1 max 2 lines, subhead max 20 words, primary CTA visible without scrolling.
- **No** repeated identical 3-column icon-card rows across sections.
- Vary structure: split hero → offerings (list, staggered grid, or bento) → gallery → visit → contact.
- Max 1 small uppercase eyebrow per 3 sections. Nav ~64–72px, phone or CTA visible on desktop.
- Cards only when elevation adds hierarchy; prefer spacing, rules, and type otherwise.

### Color & typography (you decide)
**Stitch decides all colors.** There is no brand manual, no website, and nothing to extract.
Derive a cohesive 4–5 color system from business type, name, location, and post voice.
Define `--brand-primary`, `--brand-secondary`, `--brand-accent`, and neutrals in `:root`.
Each business must look visually distinct — do not reuse the same palette across mockups.
Avoid Facebook platform grays (#333, #666, #ddd) and generic SaaS purple/indigo.

Choose typography that matches **Salon / spa / personal care** — premium and readable.
Suggested pairing (you may adapt if a better fit exists): **Lora** (headlines) + **Work Sans** (body).
Load from Google Fonts. Never default to Inter, Roboto, or Arial as the primary personality.
Establish a clear type scale (display, h2, body, small) with intentional letter-spacing on labels.

- No purple/indigo SaaS gradients. No generic cream/beige page background unless the business genuinely calls for it.
- No em dashes (—) in copy. No emojis. No buzzwords: elevate, seamless, world-class, game-changer.

### Motion & interaction (emil-design-eng)
- Dials: variance 9/10 · motion 4/10 · density 6/10
- UI transitions: 150–250ms, **ease-out**. Never `transition: all`.
- Buttons: `:active { transform: scale(0.97) }`. Include `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Animate **transform** and **opacity** only.

### Anti-slop checklist
- No fake star ratings unless review score is in the brief.
- No side-stripe accent borders on cards. No gradient text on headlines.
- No lorem ipsum. No stock URLs. Gallery and hero sized for **their** Facebook photos.
- Form is preview-only — never simulate "Message sent".

### Photo inventory

You will receive 12 real Facebook photos: hero = storefront/work sample, gallery slots = additional post photos. Design image areas as 16:9 or 4:3 placeholders.

Use `<img>` with descriptive `alt`. Design generous photo regions (hero, gallery, about) — real Facebook images replace placeholders after build.

---

### Anti-template rules

- **No** Tailwind CDN, utility-only pages, or Material Symbols as the primary UI system.
- **No** identical 3-column icon-card rows repeated across sections.
- **No** purple/indigo SaaS gradients, Inter/Roboto defaults, or cream-beige "AI landing" backgrounds unless the business genuinely calls for it (heritage bakery, ranch, etc.).
- **No** `transition: all` — animate transform and opacity with purpose; `:active` scale on buttons.
- **No** fake star widgets, "#1 rated", or unverifiable awards unless review score is provided above.
- **No** stock URLs or AI placeholder image services.
- **No emojis** in headings, buttons, or body copy.
- **No** em dashes (—) in copy — use commas, periods, or hyphens.
- Phone must be a visible `tel:` link in header and hero.
- No food menu language. Gallery should showcase work, not template beauty shots.

**Design dials for this build:** variance 9/10 · motion 4/10 · density 6/10

### Deliverable

**Full website:** semantic HTML5, dedicated `styles.css`, dedicated `script.js`.

**Responsive:** 390px mobile, 768px tablet, 1280px desktop — no horizontal scroll; hero + primary CTA visible on first mobile screen.

**Interactive:** mobile nav (`data-nav-toggle`), smooth anchor scroll, contact form UI with validation (**preview only** — show notice, never fake "sent").

**Copy:** from Facebook scrape and post captions — no lorem ipsum.

**Layout:** follow archetype **bento-showcase** but interpret it boldly; vary section rhythm (full-bleed band → narrow column → split → gallery mosaic, etc.).

### Required capabilities (implement with unique structure and naming)

1. **Header** — wordmark or logotype treatment, nav, phone visible on desktop
2. **Hero** — The Best Nails Salon in Warner Robins, subhead, Book appointment, your invented palette dominant
3. **Credibility** — `#credibility` — only verifiable trust (local, years serving, review score if provided)
4. **Offerings** — services from bullets above, not generic filler
5. **About** — specific details from scraped profile and posts
6. **Gallery** — photo grid sized for Facebook images
7. **Visit** — `#visit` — address, hours; map panel: `<div class="map-slot" data-map-slot aria-label="Map"></div>` (empty — map injected at build)
8. **Contact** — form + phone + email
9. **Footer** — hours, address, space for mockup disclaimer

### Technical

- CSS custom properties for your invented palette and type scale
- Accessible contrast, focus rings, landmarks
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — disable motion, keep opacity/color
- Mockup banner placeholder at top: "Concept preview — not affiliated with Le’s Nails & Spa"
